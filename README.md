## Introduction

The HiRISC Dataset focuses on scenarios that pose significant risks for collision avoidance systems in autonomous vehicles. By analyzing these high-risk situations, we aim to improve algorithms that help vehicles make safer decisions. This dataset includes various driving scenarios, sensor data, and annotated events that contribute to a comprehensive understanding of collision avoidance.

## Dataset Overview

The HiRISC Dataset contains:

- **Driving Scenarios**: A variety of simulated and real-world driving situations that include both normal and risky interactions.
- **Sensor Data**: Data collected from various sensors such as LIDAR, cameras, and radar.
- **Annotated Events**: Key events and interactions that indicate potential collision risks, along with timestamps and contextual information.

The dataset is structured to facilitate easy access and analysis. It is suitable for machine learning applications, algorithm testing, and research purposes.

## Installation

To get started with the HiRISC Dataset, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Dataset**: Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/hardik7577/HiRISC-Dataset/releases) to download the latest version of the dataset. Make sure to download the appropriate files for your needs.
2. **Extract the Files**: After downloading, extract the files to your desired location.
3. **Set Up Your Environment**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can use the following command to install required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Load the Data**: Use the provided scripts to load the dataset into your project.

## Usage

Once you have the dataset set up, you can start using it in your projects. Here are some basic examples:

### Loading the Dataset

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('path/to/dataset.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())
```

### Analyzing Collision Risks

You can analyze collision risks by examining the annotated events. For example:

```python
# Filter for high-risk scenarios
high_risk_events = data[data['risk_level'] == 'high']

# Display high-risk events
print(high_risk_events)
```

## Data Structure

The dataset is organized into several key components:

- **Scenario Files**: Each scenario file contains detailed information about a specific driving scenario, including timestamps, sensor readings, and annotated events.
- **Metadata**: Metadata files provide context about the scenarios, including descriptions, conditions, and any assumptions made during data collection.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is included to guide users through the dataset and its structure.
